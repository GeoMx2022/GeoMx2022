# Hi, I'm Max 
I'm a junior full-stack software developer with a passion for bringing my ideas to life through code. 

In a previous life, I was a teacher - A career I enjoyed and where I developed many invaluable soft skills (such as leadership and management). However, I am now determined to enter tech given it's critical future importance - The endless possibilities in this industry really excite me. 

As such, I have recently completed an intensive, industry-leading, 13 week Software Development Bootcamp and I am working hard to develop my technical skills further everyday. 

Overall, I'm a dilligent and driven developer who is always willing to work hard and learn something new. 

Currently, I'm looking to join an innovative company where I can make a real difference, especially if I can combine that with my extensive experience in education.   

I'd love to hear from you! Reach out by:
